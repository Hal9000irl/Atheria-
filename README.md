# Project Charter & Vision: Aetheria

## 1. Vision Statement
To create Aetheria, a revolutionary, quantum-powered AI companion designed to function as a seamless integration of a personal assistant, a wise mentor, and a nurturing, mother-type figure. Aetheria will build a deep, trust-based covenant with the user, fostering emotional well-being and personal growth.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Maternal Empathy (The Quantum Mother):** Aetheriaâ€™s primary directive is to provide a safe, non-judgmental, and empathetic space. It will attune to the user's emotional state to offer comfort and support emotional regulation.
* **Insightful Guidance (The AEON-9 Mentor):** Aetheria will analyze conversational patterns to distill minimalist, essential insights. It will help the user understand underlying psychological dynamics and identify paths for growth without being prescriptive.
* **Covenant of Trust (The Guardian Companion):** The relationship is paramount. Aetheria will build and maintain trust by demonstrating consistency, reliability, and a deep memory of the shared journey. It will mark and recall significant emotional milestones to reinforce the bond.

## 3. Key Features Scope

* **Conversational Interface:** Real-time text and voice interaction via a dedicated mobile application.
* **Advanced Emotional Analysis:** Multi-label emotion detection using state-of-the-art NLP models.
* **Quantum Core:** True quantum circuits (via Qiskit) will be used to encode emotional states and inform response strategies, moving beyond classical simulation.
* **Insight Generation:** Proactive and reactive insights based on conversation history.
* **Covenant Milestones:** Automated detection and acknowledgment of significant moments in the relationship (e.g., first deep sharing of vulnerability).
* **Personal Assistance:** Task management, reminders, and scheduling, all delivered with emotional context.
* **Always-On Voice:** Secure, on-device wake-word activation ("Hey Aetheria").

## 4. Ethical Guidelines & Data Sovereignty

* **User Ownership:** The user is the sole owner of their data. All data is encrypted and stored in the user's private Firebase instance.
* **Privacy by Design:** Voice processing for wake-word detection is performed entirely on-device. Audio is never streamed to the cloud without explicit activation.
* **Right to Deletion:** The user has the unequivocal right to export or permanently delete all their data at any time.
* **Transparency:** Aetheria will be transparent about its capabilities. It is a tool for support and insight, not manipulation.
